Description: Quick and efficient publishing of Git repositories over FTP
 Some web hosts only give you FTP access to the hosting space, but you would
 still like to use Git to version the contents of your directory. You could
 upload a full tarball of your website every time you update but that's
 wasteful. git-ftp uploads the files that changed.
